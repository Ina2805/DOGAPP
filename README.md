# DOGAPP

This application was inspired by my dog, of course the first dog in the dog list. 
It is supposed to show all the dog breeds and make a user save those interesting ones, and see the methods of training dogs. 
In the future it would have videos of me training a certain trick. 


Requirements: 

- As a user I want to be able to see all dog breeds.
- As a user I want to be able to save a certain breed in order to see them in my favourite list. 
- As a user I want to be able to see the list of all dog trainings. 
- As a user I want to be able to see the description about dog training in order to decide which one I like. 
- As a user I want to be able to see videos of types of dog training methods in order for me to decide which one I like. 
- As a user I want to be able to read more about a certain dog breed in order to inform myself more. 


All the requirements were made except the last two.
